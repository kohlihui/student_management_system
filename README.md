# Student Management System

This is a simple Student Management System built using ASP.NET MVC, based on the .NET Framework. The system is designed to help manage student information efficiently, including features such as adding, editing, viewing, and deleting student records. It serves as a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application, ideal for learning purposes or as a foundation for more advanced student management systems. The project follows the MVC architectural pattern and demonstrates the use of controllers, models, and views to deliver a structured and scalable application.
